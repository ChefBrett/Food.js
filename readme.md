# Food.js
## raw cooking data, and tools to read it

http://wraybowling.github.io/Food.js/

In countries where the metric system is employed, cooking involves fewer headaches and more accurate outcomes. Following recipies feels less like guess-work, and less like math class. This simplicity has less to do with the metric system itself, and more to do with the introduction of electronic food scales. It turns out that "feeling out" the difference between 100g of something and 110g in the United States customary system is... customarily ignored! We don't actually pay attention to a few extra teaspoons when we cook. But with metric, you can. With a scale you can. Because the metric system on a food scale has a much higher resolution, you don't have to think of it as "european." Think of it, rather, as Digital HD Ingredient Measuring.

This cookbook aims to do away with peoples' feelings. No one will tell you how delicious the recipe is. There are no stories to read. No one will tell you about their wonderful time in Venice when they had this dish with their aunt Jenn. Likewise, there are no units anywhere. This cookbook has none of those things.

Food.js is written in JavaScript. The format is simple, streamlined, and completely void of anything more than the measurements of necessary ingredients. The reader included will allow you to scale the recipe to any arbitrary size. For example, if you only have 31 grams of flour for a roux, you will be advised to use precisely 31 grams of butter.

Please feel free to send in your recipes as pull requests, and do not be surprised when they are forked and adjusted. That is actually the most delightful thing about cookbooksâ€”how they mutate. What better way to fascilitate such a thing than through Github?



Enjoy your meals,
